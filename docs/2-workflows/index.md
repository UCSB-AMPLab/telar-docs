# Workflows

Telar offers two workflows for creating your exhibitions. Choose the one that best fits your needs and technical knowledge.

## GitHub Web Interface

**No installation required!** Manage your entire project through GitHub's web interface and Google Sheets.

**Best for:**
- Storytellers and content creators
- Teams collaborating on content
- Quick prototyping
- Users who prefer not to install software

## Local Development

Preview changes locally before publishing. Full control over the build process.

**Best for:**
- Developers
- Advanced customization
- Testing changes before deployment
- Working offline

## Content Management Options

Both workflows support two content management approaches:

### Google Sheets (Recommended)
Manage content through a familiar spreadsheet interface. Ideal for teams and most users.

### CSV Files (Optional)
Edit CSV files directly in your repository. Works entirely through GitHub without external services.
