# Step 2: Plan Your Narrative

Understanding Telar's narrative model will help you plan your content effectively.

Each page in your Telar site contains one or more stories, which can be independent or related narratives. Stories unfold through successive steps that show an image (or a detail of an image) alongside a brief text.

## The Question/Answer/Invitation Pattern

Each step follows this pattern:

- **Question**: Draws viewers in with a compelling heading
- **Answer**: A brief 1-2 sentence response
- **Invitation**: "Learn more" opens a layer panel with extended information

You can provide up to two layer panels in each step to give viewers further information.

## Layered Panels

Layer panels are where you can expand on your narrative. They are written in [markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/), allowing you to include:

- Headings, bold and italic text
- Links and lists
- Additional images
- Embedded videos or 3D renderings

## Planning Your Story

Before you start gathering materials or building your site, take time to sketch out your story's structure:

1. What stories do you want to tell?
2. What are the key moments in each story?
3. What images or details will anchor each step in the story?
4. What information belongs in the brief answer and what in the panel layers?

Drafting these answers and panels will make the implementation much easier.
