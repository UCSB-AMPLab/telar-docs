# Set Up Your Site

Telar offers three ways to build your exhibition, depending on your needs and technical comfort.

## Choose Your Path

### Quick Start — Google Sheets + GitHub

Build a complete exhibition in your browser. No software to install — just a Google account and a GitHub account.

- Manage all content in a Google Sheets spreadsheet
- Upload images to GitHub or use IIIF images from museums and libraries
- GitHub Pages publishes your site automatically

This is the right starting point for most users.

Want even more guidance? The [Guided Quick Start](/docs/workflows/guided-quickstart/) walks you through setup step by step and generates your configuration file automatically — no YAML editing required.

### Going Further — Add Markdown Files

Once your site is up and running, you can enhance story panels with richer content by adding markdown files to your repository. This builds on what you created in the Quick Start.

Add markdown files when you need widgets (carousels, tabs, accordions), longer narratives with headings, or content reused across stories. Everything else stays in your spreadsheet.

### Local Development — CSV + Jekyll

Work entirely on your computer with CSV files and a local Jekyll server. No Google Sheets, no GitHub — you control everything.

Best for digital humanities courses, power users, and anyone who wants to teach or learn version control, static sites, and structured data alongside building their exhibition.
