# For Developers

Technical documentation for developers, contributors, and those maintaining Telar forks.

## Who This Section Is For

This section is designed for:
- **Developers** building features or fixing bugs in Telar
- **Maintainers** of Telar forks for specific institutions
- **Contributors** wanting to understand Telar's architecture
- **Advanced users** troubleshooting build issues or customizing the framework

If you're a storyteller creating content for a Telar site, you probably want the main documentation sections instead.
