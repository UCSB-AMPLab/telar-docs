# Set Up Your Site

Choose a setup method based on your needs and technical comfort.

## Setup Methods

### Manual Setup — Google Sheets + GitHub

Build a complete exhibition in your browser. No software to install — just a Google account and a GitHub account. This is the step-by-step manual approach for users already comfortable with GitHub and YAML.

{: .tip }
> **New to GitHub?** The [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start/) is an easier starting point — it walks you through setup interactively and generates your configuration file automatically.

### Local Development — CSV + Jekyll

Work entirely on your computer with CSV files and a local Jekyll server. No Google Sheets, no GitHub — you control everything.

Best for digital humanities courses, power users, and anyone who wants to teach or learn version control, static sites, and structured data alongside building their exhibition.
