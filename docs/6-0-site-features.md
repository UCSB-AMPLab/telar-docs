# Site Features

Telar includes several built-in features that enhance your exhibition beyond the core story experience.

- [Objects Gallery](/docs/site-features/objects-gallery/) — A browsable, searchable gallery page for your entire collection, with filtering by type, creator, period, and subjects
- [Glossary](/docs/site-features/glossary/) — Define terms that viewers can look up from within stories without leaving the narrative
- [Private Stories](/docs/site-features/private-stories/) — Encrypt stories so only viewers with the correct key can access them
- [Custom Pages](/docs/site-features/custom-pages/) — Create standalone pages for content outside the story structure — about, credits, methodology
- [Embedding in Canvas](/docs/site-features/embedding/) — Embed your Telar site or individual stories in learning management systems
