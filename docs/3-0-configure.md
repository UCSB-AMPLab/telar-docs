# Configure Your Site

Telar's behavior is controlled through `_config.yml`, a YAML file in the root of your repository. It sets your site's title, theme, language, Google Sheets connection, and feature toggles.

If you used the [Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start/), you already have a working `_config.yml`. This section helps you understand what's in it and how to change it.

## In This Section

- [Config Generator and Editor](/docs/configure/config-generator/) — Build a new `_config.yml` from scratch or load an existing one to edit
- [Configuration Reference](/docs/configure/configuration/) — Complete list of every setting and what it does
- [Config Validator](/docs/configure/config-validator/) — Paste your `_config.yml` to check for errors before committing
