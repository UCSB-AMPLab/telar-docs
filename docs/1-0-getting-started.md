# Getting Started

Welcome to Telar! Choose a starting point based on what you need:

### I want to build my first exhibition

The **[Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start/)** walks you through setup step by step — from creating your repository to publishing your first story. It generates your configuration file automatically.

### I want to understand Telar's narrative model

**[How Telar Works](/docs/getting-started/how-telar-works/)** explains the layered storytelling structure — stories, steps, questions, and panels — so you can plan your content before building.

### I want to set Telar up manually or on my local system

If you already understand the basics and want to configure your site yourself, head to **[Set Up Your Site](/docs/setup/)**. Choose between [Manual Setup](/docs/setup/manual/) (GitHub web interface) or [Local Development](/docs/setup/local-dev/) (CSV + Jekyll on your computer).
