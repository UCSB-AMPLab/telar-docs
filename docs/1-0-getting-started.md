# Getting Started

Welcome to Telar! This tutorial walks you through building your first exhibition in four steps:

1. **[Quick Start](/docs/getting-started/quick-start/)** — Set up your repository, Google Sheet, and configuration
2. **[Plan Your Narrative](/docs/getting-started/narrative-structure/)** — Understand how stories, steps, and panels fit together
3. **[Add Your Content](/docs/getting-started/add-content/)** — Upload images, fill in your spreadsheet, and create your first story
4. **[Review and Refine](/docs/getting-started/review-refine/)** — Set image coordinates, review your site, and polish

### I already know the basics

If you want to configure your site manually or work locally, head to **[Set Up Your Site](/docs/setup/)**. Choose between [Manual Setup](/docs/setup/manual/) (GitHub web interface) or [Local Development](/docs/setup/local-dev/) (CSV + Jekyll on your computer).
