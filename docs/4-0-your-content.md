# Your Content

Your exhibition is built from several types of content — objects, images, stories, and supporting pages. All source content lives in the `components/` folder of your repository. You define the structure through spreadsheet files (via [Google Sheets](/docs/your-data/google-sheets/) or [CSV](/docs/your-data/csv-project/)), and write longer narrative content in markdown files.

- [Objects](/docs/your-content/objects/) — The visual items your stories explore — images, maps, documents, photographs
- [Self-Hosted Images](/docs/your-content/self-hosted-images/) — Upload your own images and Telar generates zoomable tiles automatically
- [External IIIF Images](/docs/your-content/external-iiif/) — Use images from museums, libraries, and other IIIF providers
- [Stories & Panels](/docs/your-content/stories-panels/) — Step-by-step narratives built around your objects, with expandable detail panels
- [Rich Content with Markdown](/docs/your-content/rich-content/) — Enhance story panels with longer narratives, embedded media, and reusable content
- [Markdown Syntax](/docs/your-content/markdown-syntax/) — Formatting reference for markdown files used in panels and pages
- [Widgets](/docs/your-content/widgets/) — Interactive elements for story panels and custom pages — carousels, tabs, accordions
