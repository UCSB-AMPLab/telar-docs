# Telar

**A minimal computing framework for creating visual narrative exhibitions with IIIF images and scrollytelling.**

{: .beta }
> **Beta Release - v0.3.3-beta**
> This release fixes a critical workflow bug. Version 0.3.2-beta added image sizing syntax for panel markdown and customizable index page. Version 0.3.1-beta fixed critical bugs with image and thumbnail loading.

## What is Telar?

Telar (Spanish for "loom") weaves together IIIF images, narrative text, and layered contextual information into interactive visual narrative exhibitions. It follows minimal computing principles: plain text authoring, static generation, and sustainable hosting.

Developed by Adelaida Ávila, Juan Cobo Betancourt, Santiago Muñoz, and students and scholars at the [UCSB Archives, Memory, and Preservation Lab](https://ampl.clair.ucsb.edu), the UT Archives, Mapping, and Preservation Lab, and [Neogranadina](https://neogranadina.org).

## Key Features

- **IIIF Integration:** Support for both local images (auto-generated tiles) and external IIIF resources from museums and libraries worldwide.
- **Scrollytelling:** Discrete step-based scrolling with support for multiple IIIF objects in a single story - each object preloaded in its own viewer card.
- **Layered Panels:** Progressive narratives with three content layers plus glossary for rich, contextual storytelling.
- **Objects Gallery:** See all the objects in the exhibition laid out in a grid. Clicking on an object provides further details about it.
- **Minimal Computing:** Plain text authoring, static generation, and sustainable GitHub Pages hosting.
- **Google Sheets Integration:** Manage content through a familiar spreadsheet interface - ideal for teams and non-technical users.
