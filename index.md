# Telar

**A minimal computing framework for creating visual narrative exhibitions with IIIF images and scrollytelling.**

{: .beta }
> **Beta Release - v0.5.0-beta**
> This release adds complete Canvas LMS embedding support, share/embed UI with platform presets, extended image format support (HEIC/iPhone photos, WebP, TIFF), flattened image directory structure, and CSV-driven IIIF tile generation.

## What is Telar?

Telar (Spanish for "loom") weaves together IIIF images, narrative text, and layered contextual information into interactive visual narrative exhibitions. It follows minimal computing principles: plain text authoring, static generation, and sustainable hosting.

Developed by Adelaida Ávila, Juan Cobo Betancourt, Santiago Muñoz, and students and scholars at the [UCSB Archives, Memory, and Preservation Lab](https://ampl.clair.ucsb.edu), the UT Archives, Mapping, and Preservation Lab, and [Neogranadina](https://neogranadina.org).

We gratefully acknowledge the support of the [Caribbean Digital Scholarship Collective](https://cdscollective.org), the [Center for Innovative Teaching, Research, and Learning (CITRAL)](https://citral.ucsb.edu/home) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, the [UCSB Library](https://library.ucsb.edu), the [Routes of Enslavement in the Americas University of California MRPI](https://www.humanities.uci.edu/routes-enslavement-americas), and the [Department of History of The University of Texas at Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/history/).

## Key Features

- **IIIF Integration:** Support for both local images (auto-generated tiles) and external IIIF resources from museums and libraries worldwide.
- **Scrollytelling:** Discrete step-based scrolling with support for multiple IIIF objects in a single story - each object preloaded in its own viewer card.
- **Layered Panels:** Progressive narratives with three content layers plus glossary for rich, contextual storytelling.
- **Objects Gallery:** See all the objects in the exhibition laid out in a grid. Clicking on an object provides further details about it.
- **Minimal Computing:** Plain text authoring, static generation, and sustainable GitHub Pages hosting.
- **Google Sheets Integration:** Manage content through a familiar spreadsheet interface - ideal for teams and non-technical users.
